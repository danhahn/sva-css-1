In addition to the standard voice function of a mobile phone, telephone, current mobile phones may support many additional services, and accessories, such as SMS for text messaging, email, packet switching for access to the Internet, gaming, Bluetooth, infrared, camera with video recorder and MMS for sending and receiving photos and video, MP3 player, radio and GPS. Most current mobile phones connect to a cellular network of base stations (cell sites), which is in turn interconnected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN) (the exception is satellite phones).</p>				<h2><a name="History"></a>History</h2>		<p>In 1908, U.S. Patent 887,357  for a wireless telephone was issued in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Stubblefield">Nathan B. Stubblefield</a> of Murray, Kentucky. He applied this patent to "cave radio" telephones and not directly to cellular telephony as the term is currently understood.[2] Cells for mobile phone base stations were invented in 1947 by Bell Labs engineers at AT&amp;T and further developed by Bell Labs during the 1960s. Radiophones have a long and varied history going back to Reginald Fessenden's invention and shore-to-ship demonstration of radio telephony, through the Second World War with military use of radio telephony links and civil services in the 1950s, while hand-held cellular radio devices have been available since 1973. A patent for the first wireless phone as we know today was issued in US Patent Number 3,449,750 to George Sweigert of Euclid, Ohio on June 10, 1969.</p>		<p>In 1945, the zero generation (0G) of mobile telephones was introduced. 0G mobile phones, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Telephone_Service">Mobile Telephone Service</a>, were not cellular, and so did not feature "handover" from one base station to the next and reuse of radio frequency channels.[citation needed] Like other technologies of the time, it involved a single, powerful base station covering a wide area, and each telephone would effectively monopolize a channel over that whole area while in use. The concepts of frequency reuse and handoff as well as a number of other concepts that formed the basis of modern cell phone technology are first described in U.S. Patent 4,152,647 , issued May 1, 1979 to Charles A. Gladden and Martin H. Parelman, both of Las Vegas, Nevada and assigned by them to the United States Government.</p>		<p>This is the first embodiment of all the concepts that formed the basis of the next major step in mobile telephony, the Analog cellular telephone. Concepts covered in this patent (cited in at least 34 other patents) also were later extended to several satellite communication systems. Later updating of the cellular system to a digital system credits this patent.</p>		<h2><a name="Handsets"></a>Handsets</h2>		<p>There are several categories of mobile phones, from basic phones to feature phones such as musicphones and cameraphones, to smartphones. The first smartphone was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_9000_Communicator">Nokia 9000 Communicator</a> in 1996 which incorporated PDA functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturisation and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today. Several phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM BlackBerry focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the Nokia N-Series of multimedia phones; and the Apple iPhone which provides full-featured web access and multimedia capabilities.</p>		<h3>Features</h3>		<p>Mobile phones often have features beyond sending <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_message">text messages</a> and making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_call">voice calls</a>, including call registers, GPS navigation, music (MP3) and video (MP4) playback, RDS radio receiver, alarms, memo and document recording, personal organiser and personal digital assistant functions, ability to watch streaming video or download video for later viewing, video calling, built-in cameras (3.2+ Mpx) and camcorders (video recording), with autofocus and flash, ringtones, games, PTT, memory card reader (SD), USB (2.0), infrared, Bluetooth (2.0) and WiFi connectivity, instant messaging, Internet e-mail and browsing and serving as a wireless modem for a PC, and soon will also serve as a console of sorts to online games and other high quality games.</p>		<p>Some phones includes touchscreen. The total value of mobile data services exceeds the value of paid services on the Internet, and was worth 31 billion dollars in 2006 (source Informa).[citation needed] The largest categories of mobile services are music, picture downloads, videogaming, adult entertainment, gambling, video/TV.</p>		<h2><a name="Terminology"></a>Terminology</h2>		<ul>			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_phone">Car phone</a> -  A type of telephone permanently mounted in a vehicle, these often have more powerful transmitters, an external antenna and loudspeaker for handsfree use. They usually connect to the same networks as regular mobile phones.</li>			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordless_telephone">Cordless telephone (portable phone)</a> -  Cordless phones are telephones which use one or more radio handsets in place of a wired handset. The handsets connect wirelessly to a base station, which in turn connects to a conventional land line for calling. Unlike mobile phones, cordless phones use private base stations (belonging to the land-line subscriber), and which are not shared.</li>			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Mobile_Radio">Professional Mobile Radio</a> - Advanced professional mobile radio systems can be very similar to mobile phone systems. Notably, the IDEN standard has been used as both a private trunked radio system as well as the technology for several large public providers. Similar attempts have even been made to use TETRA, the European digital PMR standard, to implement public mobile networks.</li>			<li>Radio phone - This is a term which covers radios which could connect into the telephone network. These phones may not be mobile; for example, they may require a mains power supply, they may require the assistance of a human operator to set up a PSTN phone call.</li>			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_phone">Satellite phone</a> - This type of phone communicates directly with an artificial satellite, which in turn relays calls to a base station or another satellite phone. A single satellite can provide coverage to a much greater area than terrestrial base stations. Since satellite phones are costly, their use is typically limited to people in remote areas where no mobile phone coverage exists, such as mountain climbers, mariners in the open sea, and news reporters at disaster sites. </li>		</ul>		<h2><a name="Privacy"></a>Privacy</h2>		<p>Cell phones have numerous privacy issues associated with them, and are regularly used by governments to perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance">surveillance</a>.</p>		<p>Law enforcement and intelligence services in the U.K. and the United States possess technology to remotely activate the microphones in cell phones in order to listen to conversations that take place nearby the person who holds the phone.</p>		<p>Mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data. The geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily (whether it is being used or not), using a technique known multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone.</p>	</div>	<div id="footer">		<ul>			<li><a href="policy.html">Privacy policy</a></li>			<li><a href="about.html">About Wikipedia</a></li>			<li><a href="disclaimers.html">Disclaimers</a></li>			<li>Copied for wikipedia</li>		</ul>	</div></div></body></html>
